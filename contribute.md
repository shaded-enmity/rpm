## How to contribute to rpm.org

### Contributing Source Code

Our source code is maintained in a git repository. Clones of the repository can be made anonymously. If you have patches, or comments on the code, please discuss them on the rpm mailing lists with the rpm.org development team. If you want to hack on rpm but don't know where to start, here are some possible sources of inspiration:

* Fixing [known bugs](http://rpm.org/report/1) is always a good way to get started.
* Lots of [open bugs](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&component=rpm&query_format=advanced) can also be found in the [Red Hat bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/)
* Addressing known limitations and problems of RPM:
  * [RPM Summit at openSUSE Conference 2009](problems_summit2009.html)
  * [Problems of Scriptlets](problems_scriptlets.html)
  * [Problems of Upgrade](problems_upgrade.html)
  * Problems of Building
  * Problems of Integration
  * Problems of Layering
  * Problems of the RPM Database
  * Problems with the Python bindings
  * Distribution Differences 
  * Those who have a proven track record of contributions will be granted write access.

RPM is used as one of base tool in several large communities. Help us to identify problems of its daily usage.

### Contributing Documentation

The RPM project is always looking for more and better [documentation](documentation.html). Some documentation exists in the [source code](source.html), while other documentation exists within this wiki. To contribute documentation to the source code, see the 'Contributing Sourcecode' section above. To contribute documentation to this wiki, request wiki edit access on rpm-maint@lists.rpm.org mailing list.
